## How to Enable

1. Open Settings â†’ AI Settings
2. Find "AI Post Processing" section
3. Enable "Enable AI Post Processing" toggle

## Processing Modes

### Add as Comment
- AI analysis results are added as comments below the note
- Original note content remains unchanged
- View AI's analysis process and results

### Auto Add Tags
- AI automatically recommends and adds relevant tags based on content
- Helps better organize and categorize notes
- Improves search and discovery efficiency

### Both
- Generates both comments and adds tags simultaneously
- Most comprehensive AI processing approach

## Custom Prompts

### Post Processing Prompt
Set the prompt used by AI when analyzing notes:
```
Analyze the following note content and suggest appropriate tags and provide a brief summary
```

### Tags Prompt
Dedicated prompt for generating tags:
```
Recommend 3-5 relevant tags for the following content
```

## Workflow

1. **Create Note** - User creates a new note
2. **Trigger Processing** - System automatically detects new note
3. **AI Analysis** - Analyzes content using configured prompts
4. **Generate Results** - Adds comments or tags based on processing mode
5. **Notify User** - Sends notification when AI processing is complete

## Use Cases

### Content Analysis
- Automatically summarize long text content
- Extract key information and points
- Analyze sentiment and themes

### Smart Tagging
- Automatically categorize content
- Identify professional domains and topics
- Build consistent tagging systems

### Workflow Integration
- Automatically process meeting notes
- Intelligently organize study notes
- Classify and manage project documentation

## Important Notes

- Processing runs asynchronously in the background without affecting note creation speed
- AI analysis quality depends on selected model and prompt settings
- Can be disabled at any time without affecting already processed content
- Supports custom prompts to adapt to different use cases

## Configuration Tips

### Prompt Optimization
- Adjust prompts based on personal needs
- Clearly specify expected output format
- Include relevant contextual information

### Mode Selection
- New users recommended to start with "Add as Comment" mode
- Switch to "Both" for best results after familiarization
- Use only "Auto Add Tags" if tag management is well-organized

<Warning>
**Important Reminders**:
- AI post-processing requires AI to be enabled and models configured first
- Processing results may require manual review and adjustment
- Regularly check the quality of AI-generated tags and comments
